Study on the Short-term Electricity load forecasting (Panama case) dataset using Machine Learning methods:

Based on the Data preprocessing experiment of the dataset, we suggest the following steps for a new scientific approach for this topic:

Exploring Advanced Feature Engineering
Given that electricity load data is temporal and exhibits seasonality, we can enhance feature engineering as follows:
Lag Features: We will create lag variables that reflect the load from the previous hour, day, or week. This captures autocorrelation in time-series data.
Rolling Statistics: We will compute rolling means, medians, or variances for specific time windows to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
Holiday and Weather Data Integration: Integrating external factors like holidays, weather conditions, or public events could help improve the prediction accuracy.

ML Approach: Ensemble Learning
An innovative approach to improve electricity load forecasting can involve ensemble learning using a combination of different models to capture distinct patterns in the data.
Random Forest / Gradient Boosting: These tree-based models can capture complex nonlinear relationships between time-series features and electricity load. Combining them with autoregressive models could enhance accuracy.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks): As a time-series problem, using LSTM neural networks can be powerful for capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies.
Hybrid Model (LSTM + XGBoost): A hybrid model that first uses LSTM to capture time-series patterns, then applies XGBoost to residual errors, can help refine predictions.

Proposed Methodology: Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)
A more advanced approach could be using Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), a relatively new technique that has shown high performance in time-series forecasting tasks.

Why TFT?
Interpretability: TFT provides insight into the importance of input variables over time, which is crucial for load forecasting in understanding which factors impact load the most.
Handling Complex Temporal Dynamics: It combines multi-horizon forecasting with attention mechanisms, which can focus on relevant periods of time or significant trends.
Handling Missing Data and Variable Input Lengths: This model is well-suited for time-series data that may have irregular intervals or missing data points.

The model architecture consists of three main parts:
Temporal Pattern Attention: Identifies important time steps in the sequence and allows the model to focus on relevant historical patterns.
Variable Selection Networks: Assign importance to input variables dynamically.
LSTM Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Captures the sequential nature of time-series data while managing variable input lengths.

Additional Enhancements
Hyperparameter Tuning with Bayesian Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning using methods like Bayesian optimization (via libraries like Optuna) can help improve model performance.
Ensemble Forecasting: After applying different models (like LSTM, Random Forest, and TFT), an ensemble of the predictions can be generated to improve overall accuracy by averaging or using a weighted voting mechanism.

Performance Metrics
Once the new model is developed, we can compare its performance with existing models based on metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)


Conclusion
For our expected approach, integrating a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for its advanced time-series modeling capabilities, combined with other ensemble techniques like LSTM and XGBoost, would provide an innovative 
direction for short-term electricity load forecasting. Adding external data sources (such as weather or holidays) and performing feature engineering would further enhance model performance.
